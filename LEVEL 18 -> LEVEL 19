🎯 Objective:
      Login despite being immediately logged out, and read the password file.

Steps to be followed:

Step 1: Try normal login (you’ll get kicked)

ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Password: kTJ0nXZsG5xGJpZ1yY6bJzKjJ9w4kQ3B

You’ll be logged out instantly due to .bashrc.
There is a Trick: Execute a command during login

Run a command directly over SSH:
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 cat readme
Enter the password when asked.

Output:

Password for Level 19: cGWpMaK0v1Y0G8h6RjO5H0FJtFf2cK2m
