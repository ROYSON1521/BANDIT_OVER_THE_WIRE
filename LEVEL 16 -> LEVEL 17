🎯 Objective:
        Find the correct SSL service port, then retrieve an SSH private key for the next level.

Steps to be followed:

Step 1: Login as bandit16

ssh bandit16@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Password: cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd

Step 2: Scan open ports

Ports are between 31000–32000, and one uses SSL.
Command: nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost
Output:
    31518 open ssl/echo
    31790 open ssl/unknown

Step 3: Connect to the correct SSL port

The correct one is 31790.
Command: openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790
When connected, give your bandit16 password: cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd

Step 4: Save the private SSH key

You’ll receive an SSH private key.
Copy it completely (from -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- to -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----).
(then)
Create a file: nano sshkey17
We should paste the key + save + exit. (then)
Fix permissions using the command: chmod 600 sshkey17

Step 5: Login as bandit17 using the key

ssh -i sshkey17 bandit17@localhost -p 2220

Step 6: Inorder to get or reveal the password.

Command: cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit17

Output: 

Password for Level 17: xLYVMN4h6w5tQ2uZx0ydJ4nZZzAxpWnn
